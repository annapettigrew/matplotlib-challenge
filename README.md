In this study, a set number of Mice were identified with a tumor growth and were treated with different drug regimens.

In this assignment, I put together a series of charts and graphs to compare the performance on the different regimens.

This included:
   
    Cleaning the data
    Generating summary statistics 
    Generating Bar and Pie Charts
    Calculating quartiles, finding outliers, and creating a box plot
    Creating line plot and scatter plots
    Calculating correlation and regression
    

Observations and Insights
    1 - The Drug Regimens Capomulin and Ramicane semmed to have the greatest effect on Tumor Volume
    2 - There were slightly more male mice than female mice but the data was close to even
    3 - The higher the timepoint the lower the tumor volume
